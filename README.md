# Line-Following-Robot
Robot that will follow a black line however long and however twisted
very basic code written in python language. This suitable wit libraries like opencv to fully operate. I also am using mjpg streamer to stream the camera feed of my robot which can be accessed easily through the code.
The code is in pycharm but can be used and adapted to any IDE.
